# CPE212_Final_Goins
This is the GitHub repository that I am using to store my C++ program for turning ARM32v7 assembly files into machine code files.
This program was written exclusively by Quin Goins for an assignment at The University of Alabama in Huntsville.

## Building
Download the source stuff from the .zip, extract it into your directory of choice, and then run the "make" command to build it.
## Execution
Run the program as follows: ./assembler <inputFile.s> <outputFile.asm>
